      'The bus hissed as it came to a stop, its brakes releasing a sigh that echoed Emma’s own as she stepped onto the cracked pavement of Greyhaven’s main street.\nTen years hadn’t changed the salty scent of the sea or the way the breeze tugged at her coat, playful and familiar. \nThe town looked the same—chipped paint on storefronts, flower boxes clinging to life, and that ever-present fog curling at the edges of the cliffs. \nShe pulled her duffel strap tighter over her shoulder and took a long breath. Home.\n“Emma Hayes?” a voice called out. \nShe turned, blinking against the sunlight. \nA tall woman with wild curls and a familiar smirk approached her with arms outstretched. \n“God, I thought it was you!” \nIt was Marley Quinn, her best friend in high school and apparently, still impossible to miss.\nEmma smiled, a little hesitant. \n“Hey, Marley.” \n“You look like someone who just walked out of a city magazine,” Marley said, looping her arm through Emma’s and steering her toward a waiting car. \n“Still allergic to texting people before you show up, huh?” \nInside the car, Marley kept talking—about the bakery closing, the new mayor who was definitely crooked, and how Noah never really left town. \nThat last name sat between them like a dropped stone, causing Emma to glance out the window, jaw tightening. \nShe hadn’t told Marley the real reason she was back. \nNot yet. \nAs the coastline rolled by, and the sky darkened just a touch with approaching clouds, Emma wondered if returning was brave—or foolish.',

    mainText: `The morning mist clung to the cobblestone streets of Greyhaven as Emma stepped out of the inn, hands tucked into the sleeves of her knit cardigan. \nThe scent of salt and wet sand filled her lungs—sharper than she remembered. \nA gull cried above, circling lazily before disappearing behind the weathered rooftop of Finch’s Market. \nThe familiarity pressed into her chest like a weight and a balm all at once. \nShe walked the main road slowly, glancing at each storefront like she was flipping through the pages of an old photo album. \nThe bakery still had hand-painted signs, and the glass display was fogged from the warmth inside. \nGod, do they still make cinnamon knots on Thursdays? she wondered. \nThe air stirred with memories. \nShe hesitated at the corner, eyes drawn toward the dockside café.\n\n"Emma?" a voice called from behind. \nShe turned. \nA woman in her early thirties, apron flour-dusted and hair piled in a loose bun, stood in the bakery doorway. \nEmma squinted. \n“Grace?” she asked, stepping forward.\n\n"Grace Nichols now," the woman grinned. \n"Married Marcus—remember him? He used to trip over everything in gym class." \nShe rushed forward and embraced Emma tightly. \n“I can’t believe it. Ten years, Em. You vanished.” \nEmma gave a soft, guarded laugh. \n“Yeah, I did. It was...complicated.” \nGrace stepped back, eyes searching Emma’s. \n“Everyone thought you left because of Noah. You know he never really—well. That’s none of my business.” \nShe bit her lip, suddenly self-conscious. \n“Come on in. You want a coffee?”\n\nInside, the bakery smelled like melted sugar and rising dough. \nA few regulars looked up from their booths, eyebrows raised. \nEmma felt their eyes stick like gum to the soles of her shoes. \nGrace noticed too. \n“Ignore them. \nSmall towns are big on memories,” she said, setting down a steaming mug.\n\nEmma wrapped her hands around the cup. \n“It’s like nothing has changed. \nBut everything feels…off. \nLike I’m walking through a dream that isn’t mine anymore.”\n\nGrace nodded slowly. \n“That’s how it goes. You leave, time moves different here. Slower, but deeper. People stay stuck in the year you left.” \nShe paused. \n“Especially Noah.”\n\nEmma’s fingers tightened around the mug. \nShe didn’t reply.`,

    mainText: `\nRain tapped lightly against the windowpane of the small room Emma had rented at the Greyhaven Inn. \nShe sat cross-legged on the bed, a weathered shoebox resting on her lap. \nShe hadn’t meant to find it—it had been tucked into the back of her suitcase, stashed away in an old hoodie from college she’d grabbed last minute. \nBut now, it stared up at her like a dare.\n\nShe opened the lid.\n\nInside were envelopes, all addressed to Noah. \nNone had stamps. \nNone had been sent. \nEmma picked one at random, unfolding the paper slowly, like it might crumble. \nThe ink had faded slightly, but her words were clear—raw, unfinished pieces of a heart she thought she’d buried.\n\n“I’m sorry for walking away without telling you. \nI thought if I stayed, I’d never leave. \nAnd I needed to leave.”\n\nEmma closed her eyes. \nHer younger self bled through those words—desperate, guilty, confused. \nShe remembered writing that letter at 3 a.m. in a university dorm room, trying not to cry loud enough to wake her roommate.\n\nThere was another one. \nNo date. \nJust his name scrawled on the front in hurried pen.\n\n“You kissed me by the seawall and I thought that meant forever.\nBut then your silence scared me.\nAnd my father’s drinking. \nAnd everything I didn’t know how to fix.”\n\nShe exhaled shakily and folded the letter back up.\n\nA knock on the door startled her. \nEmma jumped, quickly shoving the letters back into the box and sliding it under the bed. \nShe opened the door to find Mrs. Callahan, the innkeeper, holding a towel and a fresh pair of sheets.\n\n“Storm’s rolling in sooner than expected,” \nMrs. Callahan said, her voice calm but knowing. \n“Better make sure your windows are latched. Power tends to go out with the first real gust.”\n\nEmma nodded. \n“Thanks. I’ll check them.”\n\nMrs. Callahan lingered, her eyes kind but sharp. \n“You alright, dear? You’ve looked like you’re chasing ghosts since you arrived.”\n\nEmma offered a strained smile. \n“Maybe I am.”\n\nAfter the door shut, Emma sat back on the bed, staring at the window streaked with early rain. \nShe thought of Noah’s face in the grocery store—how it hadn’t hardened like she feared, but hadn’t softened either. \nSomewhere in those letters were all the things she hadn’t said. \nBut none of them prepared her for what might come next.`,

And the company.”\n\nNoah gave a soft huff. \n“You missed the company, huh? Even after all these years?”\n\nThere was no accusation in his tone, just quiet curiosity. \nShe glanced at him. \n“I missed a lot of things. You more than most.”\n\nHe didn’t answer at first. \nJust looked at her, really looked. \n“So why now? Why after all this time?”\n\nThe fire popped loudly, sending embers into the sky. \nEmma stared into it. \n“Because running only ever took me so far. \nAnd I couldn’t outrun the past forever.”`,

“You look like you’ve been carrying something heavy,” Noah said finally.

Emma nodded, eyes on the fire. “I left because I thought that’s what I needed to grow. To be someone different. But I ended up just being someone lonely.”

Noah’s jaw tensed. “You could’ve told me. I would’ve understood.”

“I didn’t think you would,” she whispered. “Back then… you stopped saying things, Noah. After my mom died, and my dad—he started drinking worse. I felt like I was drowning, and you didn’t even see it.”

He took a step closer. “I did see it. I just didn’t know how to help without losing you.”

Emma looked up at him, her voice trembling. “But you lost me anyway.”

The silence between them wasn’t empty—it was thick with memory. Then, without warning, thunder rumbled over the sea, long and low.

Noah looked toward the sky. “Storm’s coming sooner than they said. You should get inside.”

Emma nodded but didn’t move. Neither did he.`,

She called her father. The line rang six times before clicking to voicemail. She didn’t leave a message.

Restless, she walked to her childhood home on Harbor Lane. The windows were dark, and the porch sagged more than she remembered. She knocked. After a long pause, the door opened.

Her father stood there, older, greyer, a glass in his hand even now.

“You’re back,” he said, voice gravelly.

Emma swallowed hard. “Just for a while.”

He opened the door farther. “You can come in. If you want.”

Inside, the house smelled like dust and salt and silence. They sat in the same room where arguments used to echo through the floorboards.

“You blamed me for her death,” he said quietly. “Maybe I did too.”

Emma didn’t deny it. “We both needed someone to blame. But I needed you, and you weren’t there.”

He looked at her, eyes glassy. “I wasn’t ready to be someone’s anchor. Still not.”

Emma nodded slowly. “I didn’t come back for you. But maybe… maybe we both needed to say that.”`,

She texted back: Already on my way.

The streets were soaked, but the shelter buzzed with quiet urgency. Cots lined the gym floor, and people passed out blankets and hot tea. Emma found Noah in the corner, helping an elderly man settle in.

When he saw her, he offered a tired smile. “Thought you’d hole up in that inn.”

“Didn’t want to be alone,” she said.

Later, they sat on cots side by side. The storm pounded the roof like a drumbeat.

Emma turned to him. “Do you ever regret not chasing after me?”

He hesitated. “Every day. But I also thought… maybe you didn’t want to be found.”

“I wasn’t sure I did. But I think part of me hoped you would try.”

“I used to think this place would never change,” Emma said. “But maybe it just waited for me to change first.”

Noah glanced at her. “You think you’re staying this time?”

“I don’t know yet,” she admitted. “But I’m not running.”

They walked in silence, waves lapping at their feet.

Noah finally said, “I kept every letter you wrote me.”

She stopped. “You never got them. I never sent them.”
